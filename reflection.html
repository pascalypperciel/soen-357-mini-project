          <h3>Reflect on how the UX design process helped you identify user needs and improve the product.</h3>
          <p>
            The UX design process helped me identify user needs mainly through the research phase. Reading existing studies on health apps and older adults made it clear that issues like small text, cluttered interfaces, and confusing interactions come up very often. Interviewing my grandparents helped confirm that these problems actually affect real users and are not just theoretical. This research influenced many of my design decisions, such as keeping the interface simple, avoiding elements that appear and disappear quickly, and making sure important actions can be completed in one tap. Overall, the research helped ground the design in real constraints instead of assumptions.

          <h3>Discuss any challenges you encountered during the design process and how you overcame them.</h3>
          <p>
            One challenge during the design process was deciding how much to simplify the interface without removing useful functionality. Designing for older users also required being careful not to introduce interactions that could feel confusing or overwhelming. I addressed this by relying on the research and personas to guide decisions, prioritizing clear layouts, consistent navigation, and simple, forgiving interactions over adding more features.
