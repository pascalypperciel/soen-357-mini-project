        <p>
          To evaluate the usability of Health Companion, I planned a small usability test focused on whether the core interactions were clear, predictable, and easy to complete. The goal was not to test edge cases, but to validate that the most important tasks could be completed quickly and without confusion, especially for older users.
        </p>

        <p>
          The test targets users similar to the defined personas: adults who take medication regularly and may have varying levels of comfort with technology. I focused on simple, realistic tasks that reflect how the app would actually be used in daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main tasks were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Confirm a medication dose from the home screen</li>
          <li>Check upcoming medical appointments</li>
          <li>Recover from an accidental tap on the confirm button</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          During testing, I would observe whether users could complete each task without guidance, hesitation, or mistakes. I would also pay close attention to moments of uncertainty, such as searching for buttons, misinterpreting labels, or feeling unsure whether an action was successfully completed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on the design, I expect most users to complete these tasks with minimal effort. The large confirm button on the home screen should make dose confirmation straightforward, while the persistent navigation bar should help users stay oriented. For older users in particular, the undo confirmation modal is expected to reduce anxiety around accidental taps by providing a clear and forgiving way to correct mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, this usability testing is meant to confirm that the app feels simple, calm, and predictable to use, and that users can accomplish essential actions with confidence and without unnecessary interaction.
